### Guide

1. Clone the Repo
2. cd into the Repo
3. run ```npm install```
4. run ```npm run start```

### Trouble

1. There are 2 npm scripts: ```npm run compile``` & ```npm run execute```
2. Assume you run ```npm run compile``` in NodeJS 16 and later run ```npm run execute``` in NodeJS 14
3. You will get the error! I want to know if this scenario is right or not? 
    * I mean, if by design the bytenode compiled code can only run in the compiled environment then i would like to know it from the maintainers of bytenode, just to be sure!
